********* KNOWN ISSUES *********
1.  There is a known issue with HSQLDB 2.n driver which does not handle BLOB
    (Categories, Products, Customers, People) correctly
    It causes an error when loading Sales panel - Clicking OK allows you to
    continue seemingly with no adverse effect
    Adding Images to (Categories, Products, Customers, People) forms is not
    affected.
    Suggestion: avoid HSQLDB database for now or revert to older 1.8 driver

    Fix: Reverted back to Derby driver : 10.10.2
2.  Bug: Error in UpdateRecord for CSV Import
